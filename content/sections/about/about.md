I currently work as a Network Automation Engineer. 

I code in Python and I am currently sharpening my skills on Data structure and algorithms and applying Software design patterns to optimize/ refactor codebase.
I love to help others learn about coding or bring a hype about technology ðŸ˜…. I am on a journey to be a solid engineer on simplifying Network through automation.

<br>

So Far I have learned a bit about:
- VXLAN BGP EVPN
- Automating Networks with Cisco's NDFC controller
- Developed Custom Ansible modules
- Developed Modules in Terraform

When I am not at work you can find my grinding in the GYM or exploring my self through musics, books or articles.
