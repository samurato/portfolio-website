Neural Networks are the backend of what drives the autonomous systems today. From the feature that unlocks your phone with the simple glimpse of your face to self-driving cars, some form of neural networks is working behind the scene to mimic the human behaviour and in some case better. Neural Network is inspired from the very basic foundation of how our brain communicates for taking action such as feeling pain when we accidently touch a very hot surface.

The Image above is the basic structure of Neurons, any information coming from the dendrites at the beginning( which is the spiky structure that you see in the image above) is passed on to the axon terminal (which is the end) , and on to the dendrite of other neurons to the right only if a certain threshold is met.

[How Neurons work](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/human-anatomy-and-physiology/nervous-system-introduction/v/overview-of-neuron-function)  for information of biological neurons

In mathematical sense:-

x1, x2 and x3 are the dendrites or the input information which is then passed on to a processing node which calculates the the weight and input .
